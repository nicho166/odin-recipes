        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
                <li>1 medium carrot, chopped</li>
                <li>2 medium potatoes, cubed</li>
                <li>1 medium butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed</li>
                <li>1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat, and cook onion, celery, carrot, potatoes, and squash until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in enough of the chicken stock to cover vegetables.                </li>
                <li>Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer until all vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the soup to a blender, and blend until smooth. Return to the pot, and mix in any remaining stock to reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
